Here is a list of currently problematic tests.

Note I also consider a test problematic if it is written in C++11. I am using GCC 4.4 to build these tests (which does not support C++11) so I cannot use any C++11 tests. I would also much prefer to build in C mode.

6_object_wrap C++11
7_factory_wrap C++11
8_passing_wrapped C++11
test_async C++11
test_error C++11
test_general missing symbol napi_get_version
test_handle_scope FATAL ERROR: EscapeableHandleScope::Escape Escape value set twice probably because compat code is missing this fix: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/13651
test_make_callback C++11
test_object Error: Invalid pointer passed as argument probably due to compat code missing this commit: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/13250
test_typedarray ReferenceError: Reflect is not defined . Reflect.construct doesn't work on node.js 4.8.3
