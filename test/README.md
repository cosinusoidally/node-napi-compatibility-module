This is a very rough and ready test suite. It is based off the addons-napi test suite from node.js 8.1.3 (https://github.com/nodejs/node/tree/v8.1.3). The ``common`` test module is based on a hacked up version of the node.js 4.8.3 ``common.js`` module from their test suite (https://github.com/nodejs/node/tree/v4.8.3/test)
